# belly-button-challenge

In this project I utilized alot of documentation from Plotly and D3. I also utilized a lot of the calss material from module 14 in order to work my way through the project. I also utilized the Xpert Learning Assistant in order to help me. In this repo you can find all my code in the [index.html](index.html) file and the [app.js](static/js/app.js) file under the static directory.
